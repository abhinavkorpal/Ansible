The preferred way to install Ansible on a Mac is via pip.

Ansible can be installed via “pip”, the Python package manager. If ‘pip’ isn’t already available in your version of Python, you can get pip by:
```shell
$ sudo easy_install pip
```

Then install Ansible with:
```shell
$ sudo pip install ansible
```
